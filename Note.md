# PYTHON NOTES

# STEPS FOR PYTHON INSTALLATION AND SETUP

# Install Python

1.  - Download the latest version of Python from the official Python website: https://www.python.org
2.  - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
3.  - Make sure to select the option to add Python to your system's PATH during installation
4.  - Verify that Python is installed correctly by opening a command prompt or terminal and typing `python --version`
5.  - If you're using a virtual environment, you can install Python using pip: `pip install python`
6.  - If you're using a package manager like Homebrew on macOS, you can install Python using `brew install python`
7.  - If you're using a Linux distribution, you can install Python using your distribution's package manager (e.g. `apt-get install python3` on Ubuntu)

# ----------WHAT IS PYTHON ?--------------

=> Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

It is used for: 1. web development(server-side) 2. software development 3. mathmatics 4. system scripting

# ---------WHAT CAN PYTHON DO?--------------

1. Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
2. Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
3. Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
4. Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
5. Python can be used to create games, animations, or special effects.
6. Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.
7. Python can be used for data analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

# ----------WHY PYTHON?-------------

1. Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
2. Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
3. Python can be easily learned by beginners.
4. Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
5. Python can be used in a variety of domains, including web development, scientific computing, data
6. Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
7. Python has a large and active community, which means there are many resources available to help you
8. Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.

# PYTHON SYNTAX CAMPARED TO OTHER PROGRAMMING languages

1. Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.
2. Python uses indentation to define block-level structure, which can make the code look more organized and readable.
3. Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
4. Python has a vast number of libraries and tools that make the development process easier.
5. Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.
